    📆 2016

    📚 Web interface design course's project

    🔨 HTML5 & CSS3


🌟 So many things I've learned in the past years. But I'm a little proud of this project. Now, I would acomplish this project in a totally different way, but this responsive layout without CSS grid or jsvascript was a challenging way to improve my skills.
